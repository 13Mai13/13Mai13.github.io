# Context

In this trade-off document, we will explore the pros and cons of using Domain-Specific Error Handling
(DAG) versus regular try-catch methods for error handling in software development. We will weigh the
advantages and disadvantages of each approach to determine which one is best suited for different projects.

# Why do we need error handleing at all? 

For any service to be running 24/7 and reach SLO (service level objectives) error handleing is key. 

1. **Detect and recover from errors**: When an error occurs, error handling helps your program detect
the issue, log it, and take corrective action (e.g., retry the operation or terminate the program).
2. **Improve reliability**: By anticipating and preparing for potential errors, you can ensure that
your program is more reliable and less prone to crashing or producing incorrect results.
3. **Enhance user experience**: When an error occurs, a well-designed error handling mechanism can
provide helpful error messages, warnings, or hints to the user, making it easier for them to diagnose
and fix the issue.
4. **Facilitate debugging**: Error handling provides valuable information about errors that occur
during program execution, making it easier to debug and identify the root cause of the problem.
5. **Meet requirements and standards**: In many cases, error handling is a requirement or standard in

# Options

**DAG Method:**

Pros:
1.  **Improved error handling**: By focusing on specific domain-related errors, DAG provides more
targeted and efficient error handling.
2.  **Decoupling**: DAG promotes loose coupling between code modules, making it easier to modify or
replace individual components within a domain.
3.  **Better debugging**: Since DAG isolates errors within a specific domain, developers can focus on
understanding the underlying causes of issues.

Cons:
1.  **Increased complexity**: Implementing DAG requires a deeper understanding of the domain and its
specific error-handling requirements.
2.  **Over-engineering**: DAG may be overkill for simple programs or those with limited
domain-specific error handling needs.

**Regular Try-Catch Method:**

Pros:
1.  **Simpllicity**: Regular try-catch blocks are easier to implement and require less overhead than
DAG implementations.
2.  **Flexibility**: General-purpose error handling can handle a wide range of exceptions, making it
suitable for programs with diverse error-handling needs.

Cons:
1.  **Limited domain-specific error handling**: General-purpose error handling may not provide the
same level of targeted error handling as DAG.
2.  **Coupling**: Regular try-catch blocks can lead to tight coupling between code modules, making it
harder to modify or replace individual components.

## Python example


**Regular Try-Except Method:**

```
def calculate_area(length, width):
    try:
        if length <= 0 or width <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Length and Width must be positive numbers.")
        return length * width
    except TypeError:
        print("Error: Both Length and Width must be numbers.")
    except ValueError as ve:
        print(f"Error: {ve}")

print(calculate_area(4, 5))  # Output: 20
print(calculate_area(-1, 3))  # Output: Error: Length and Width must be positive numbers.
print(calculate_area('a', 3))  # Output: Error: Both Length and Width must be numbers.
```

**DAG (Domain-Specific Error Handling) Method:**

```
def calculate_area(length, width):
    if isinstance(length, (int, float)) and isinstance(width, (int, float)):
        try:
            if length <= 0 or width <= 0:
                raise ValueError("Length and Width must be positive numbers.")
            return length * width
        except TypeError:
            print("Error: Both Length and Width must be numbers.")
    else:
        raise TypeError("Both Length and Width must be numbers.")

print(calculate_area(4, 5))  # Output: 20
print(calculate_area(-1, 3))  # Output: Error: Length and Width must be positive numbers.
print(calculate_area('a', 3))  # Output: Error: Both Length and Width must be numbers.
```

In the regular try-except method example:

*   We have a single `try` block that attempts to calculate the area.
*   If any of the conditions fail (e.g., length or width is negative), it raises a `ValueError`.
*   The `except` block catches this error and prints an appropriate message.

In the DAG method example:

*   We use type checking with `isinstance()` to ensure that both `length` and `width` are numbers.
*   If they're not, we raise a `TypeError`.
*   Inside the try-except block, we still check for invalid input (negative numbers), but this time we
catch any unexpected types using a single `except TypeError:` block.

The DAG method is more specific to the domain of geometric calculations and catches errors that are
directly related to this domain. It's a more targeted approach to error handling, whereas the regular
try-except method is more general-purpose.

## Summary

| **Method** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DAG (Domain-Specific Error Handling) | Improved error handling, better debugging, decoupling |Increased complexity, over-engineering |
| Regular Try-Catch Method | Simpllicity, flexibility, ease of implementation | Limiteddomain-specific error handling, coupling between code modules |

# Trade off analysis

DAG provides more targeted error handling but is more complex to implement. Regular try-catch methods are simpler and more flexible but may not provide the same level of domain-specific error handling.


---

# Recommendation

When designing an error-handling strategy, consider the trade-offs between DAG and regular try-catch
methods:

* If you have a complex domain with specific error handling requirements, DAG might be more suitable.
* If your program has simple error handling needs or is not domain-specific, a regular try-catch block
might be sufficient.
